Hello you GitHub users, 
my name is Tim Lauer, I am 15 years old and from Germany. 
I am totally new to GitHub, so I will first have to learn a lot about using GitHub before starting with the actually coding.
My favorite language is Java. 
In a few weeks I get a new PC, and I thought of Installing Linux Mint with KDE on it, because I'm really intrested in 
Linux. 
I also got some cool ideas for a Java based Database, maybe I'll start this project here. 

May the source be with you ;-)
-Tim
